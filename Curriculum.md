## Education

### Pre-University Studies

#### Scientific Certificate - Italian Secondary School Diploma

#### Bachelor Degree in Electrical Engineering at University of Ferrara (Italy)

##### Thesis: Design and development of an RTOS-based driver for a Wi-Fi gateway

**Advisor** - Prof. Massimiliano Ruggeri

**Abstract** - The main goal of the thesis project is a cable
replacement in an embedded system through the integration of an
external wireless module. The chosen Microchip ZG2100M Wi-Fi
module does not incorporate any TCP/IP stack leaving an extra
degree of freedom to the developer to customize the functionality
according to the application requirements. The main target board
hosts an ARM-based microprocessor (STM32F407ZGT6) and the
communication with the wireless module relies on a SPI bus. The
application leans on ChibiOS, a compact and efficient open-
source real-time operating system and the development
environment consists of Eclipse CDT, GDB (Gnu Debugger) e
OpenOCD (GDB server on JTAG). The application starts with a
network scan with a subsequently connection to the desired SSID
which allows the exchange of packets over the Wi-Fi protocol.

#### MSc Degree (2nd level Degree) in Electrical and Telecommunication Engineering at University of Ferrara (Italy)

##### Thesis: NoC Spatial-temporal partitioning technology for application isolation in many-core systems

**Advisor** - Prof. Davide Bertozzi

**Abstract** - With tens or even hundreds of compute cores on a
single processor, many-core platforms provide enough
computational performance to host several applications, while
their low energy consumption makes them well-suited to serve as
programmable accelerators in the high-performance embedded
computing domain. The consolidation of several types of
applications with different criticality levels on the same hardware
platform raises severe practical issues, ranging from system
composability challenges for easier verification to performance
predictability and security concerns. The goal of this thesis is to
propose an innovative architecture with built-in hardware support
for efficient resource sharing between a multi-program workload.
The idea consists of synergistically exploiting space-division
multiplexing and time-division multiplexing to trade performance
for isolation. At the same time, the proposed architecture performs
positively in terms of minimizing the non-uniform memory access
effects. Goal of the thesis is to develop a SystemC-based platform
capable of validating the concept with high level of accuracy, and
of performing basic functional tests, as well as verifying the
engineering trade-offs.

#### Visiting Researcher at National University of Singapore

##### Thesis: Many-core architecture design for LTE base station

**Advisors** - Davide Bertozzi & Tulika Mitra

**Abstract** - The objective of this project is to design a real-time,
high-throughput, low-power base station for future 5G wireless
baseband processing using Software Defined Radio (SDR)
technology. In particular, the project is focused on many-core
architecture design for high-throughput processing, real-time
operating systems (RTOS) design to fully leverage the underlying
architecture, and an end-to-end performance evaluation with
realistic 5G applications and their corresponding network
traffic.The main challenge in 5G wireless baseband processing is
the 10x increase in throughput and 10 fold reductions in latency.
The physical layer processing is the most computationally
demanding component in the base station protocol stack.
Traditionally, the physical layer has been implemented using
customized fixed-function hardware accelerator and DSP (digital
signal processing) cores. However, these designs are inflexible in
the face of updates in the standard and supporting multiple
standards as required by SDR. Software-programmable
processors can offer easy migration path. However, current many-
core architectures (both commercial and academic) are far from
achieving 5G throughput. The goal of this project is to design fully-
programmable, power-efficient many-core architecture for real-
time, high-throughput processing of the physical layer in a base
station.

## University Projects

### Design of a power amplifier for WLAN 802.11B applications

The project focus was to assess all the specifications required by
the IEEE 802.11b standard concerning power, gain and spectral
density. To achieve the results, I relied on AWR Microwave Office
simulation tool.

### FPGA Flash Programming

The aim of the project was a simple implementation of a LPF filter
for the Altera StratixII EP2S60 FPGA with Matlab and Altera
Simulink libraries. The main achievement was to flash the
bitstream of the application in the flash memory of the board,
relying on Quartus II tool.

### Firewall implementation and cryptography

The main scope of the project was the implementation of flow
control applications, networking rules with IP-tables, routing
restrictions and development of cypher protocols with Python.

### Peer-to-peer protocols

The project consisted of the Python development of peer-to-peer
protocols like Kazaa, Gnutella, Napster and BitTorrent.

### Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing Matlab simulation

The purpose of the project was implementing a real scenario with
a base station and random number of users that want to access it,
with fairness algorithm for subcarriers’ allocation.

### Mixed-signal heart-rate monitor implementation

VHDL-based design of mixed-signal system to monitor the activity
of internal registers through I2C, DAC converter and oscilloscope.
The target system consisted of of Digilent Basys3 FPGA, Texas
Instrument ASLKPRO Board and Max 30100 heart-rate module.

### SystemC modelling of Network On-Chip router’s internal architecture

This was a course project for the course "Architecture of Digital
Integrated Systems", aimed at learning the fundamentals of
SystemC programming. Hardware modelling with SystemC
represents one third of the total course content (prof. Davide
Bertozzi). The project goal was the RTL-equivalent SystemC
implementation of the internal blocks of a 5x5 router, consisting of:
input buffers, arbiters, routing logics, crossbar and output buffers.
Finally, a deep exploration of several arbitration policies and the
evaluation of the whole structure through synthetic traffic pattern
generators were provided.
