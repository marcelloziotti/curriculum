## Work

### Intel Corporation - Ferrara (Italy) - (Apr 2022, Present)

#### Simulation and Modeling Engineer - SystemC and Simics Simulation - Technical Lead

Building on my expertise in single-IP simulation, I took on SoC-level responsibilities, managing projects that significantly impacted platform functionality and developer productivity. My work has ranged from complex interconnect design to systemic improvements in build systems, testing frameworks, and quality assurance. These efforts earned me a promotion to Technical Lead, where I now mentor colleagues, lead critical initiatives, and drive innovation in Intelâ€™s SoC simulation platforms.

Key Contributions:

- **Pantherlake Sideband Topology Update & First Boot:** Designed and validated a Sideband network to enable multi-die, multi-domain communication. Solved challenges with multicast messaging using smoke platform initialization tests. Drove together with Bios/FW and OS team first SoC boot to UEFI shell and Windows OS.
- **Build System Modernization:** Spearheaded the transition from Make to CMake with Ninja, reducing build times by 70% (from 50 to 15 minutes). Coordinated with all IP teams to align on the new build process, improving developer efficiency and CI pipelines.
- **Unit Testing Framework for IPs:** Developed a unit test framework for IP-level validation, enabling early issue detection before platform integration. Ensured adoption by collaborating with technical leads and making unit testing mandatory for integration.
- **Code Quality and TDD Integration:** Integrated code coverage monitoring into GitHub workflows to prevent test coverage regressions. Advocated for and implemented Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices, driving a cultural shift towards robust and maintainable code.
- **Technical Leadership:** Promoted to Technical Lead for contributions to simulation platforms and organizational efficiency. Mentored team members and led platform-wide initiatives to improve SoC simulation quality and performance.

### Intel Corporation - Munich (Germany) - (Jul 2018, Apr 2022)

#### Simulation and Modeling Engineer - SystemC and Simics Simulation

At Intel, I joined a seasoned team dedicated to developing and simulating Audio IP models for the Alderlake and Meteorlake SoC platforms. Starting with smaller tasks, I rapidly transitioned to leading major initiatives, leveraging my SystemC expertise. My contributions ranged from enhancing IP models with serial interfaces to spearheading build system migrations and pioneering innovative features like Total Storage Encryption (TSE). Collaboration with cross-functional teams and external partners, including Microsoft, was integral to my success, culminating in significant improvements to SoC simulation and validation workflows.

Key Contributions:

- **Audio IP and Serial Interface Integration (Alderlake, Meteorlake):** Evaluated the integration of embedded system interfaces (e.g. I2C, I3C, SPI, UART) to the Audio IP Simics. Collaborated with IP architects for seamless validation of specifications using Simics.
- **Build System Modernization:** Migrated the Audio IP build system from Make to CMake, achieving a 70% speedup in build times. Integrated the new system into the CI pipeline, boosting productivity across the team.
- **Intel Sideband SystemC Library Update:** Led the upgrade of the Intel Sideband SystemC library to meet new architecture specifications. Partnered with the Simics Simulator team for integration into core Simics libraries, benefiting all SystemC models.
- **Camera IP 3rd Party Integration (Meteorlake):** Converted a C++ Camera IP model into a SystemC Simics model with Sideband interface. Ensured accuracy and seamless integration through close collaboration with the core IP team. Deployed CI jobs for Audio and Camera IPs, enabling reliable continuous integration.
- **NVMe Data Encryption (Lunarlake):** Designed and validated NVMe encryption based on AES-256b cryptographic algorithms creating a Device Modeling Language (DML) Simics model. Adopted Test-Driven Development (TDD) and validated functionality with the BIOS team using UEFI applications. Conducted OS-level validation with Microsoft Windows, ensuring robust performance
- **Collaboration with Microsoft:** Used Simics for OS-level validation, detecting and fixing five critical bugs in the Windows OS pre-release. Strengthened the partnership with Microsoft, setting a precedent for future SoC and OS validation collaborations.
- **Software Continuous Integration (SWCI) Initiative:** Initiated the SWCI project to integrate and test BIOS/FW components alongside SoC builds. Enabled early identification of firmware issues and streamlined the integration process. Laid the foundation for SWCI to evolve in subsequent SoC projects like Pantherlake.

### Intel Corporation - Munich (Germany) - (Feb 2018, Jul 2018)

#### Design Verification Engineer

Before transitioning to my work on Simics, I contributed to the cellular 5G chip design verification efforts, focusing on SystemVerilog and the UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) framework. This role involved both behavioral and performance/power validation, ensuring the chip met key design and functionality requirements.

One of my primary tasks was the DMA backdoor access implementation, which allowed for efficient communication and validation of internal chip components. This was my first exposure to RF/5G chip validation, where I gained foundational experience in both system-level verification and performance/power estimation, contributing to the overall design validation process.
